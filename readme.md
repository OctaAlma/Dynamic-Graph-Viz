### Dynamic Graph Visualization
##### URS Thesis Project by Octavio Almanza
##### Faculty Advisor: Dr. Nate Veldt

### Required Dependencies

This project was built on Julia 1.9 or 1.10 and requires the following Julia packages:

- ``JLD2`` - for loading and saving vectors of graph states to the ``.jld`` format
- ``LinearAlgebra`` - Necessary for eigenvalue computations for spectral layout
- ``KrylovKit`` - Necessary for eigenvalue computations for spectral layout
- ``SparseArrays`` - Used to represent graphs in an adjacency-matrix form throughout some functions
- ``Plots`` - The foundational interface to display graphs. This project uses the ``GR()`` backend.
- ``MAT`` - Necessary to read-in relevant files of the ``.mat`` format.

**Note**: Packages can be installed within the Julia REPL by pressing the ``]`` key and typing ``add PackageName``
